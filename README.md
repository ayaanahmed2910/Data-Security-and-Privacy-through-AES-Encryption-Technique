# Data-Security-and-Privacy-through-AES-Encryption-Technique
This project demonstrates data security using AES encryption to protect sensitive information. A user password generates a secure key, data is encrypted into unreadable ciphertext, and can only be decrypted with the same key, ensuring privacy and preventing unauthorized access.
